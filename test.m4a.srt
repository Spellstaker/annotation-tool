I been tryna call

2
00:00:53,072-->00:00:55,725
I been on my own for long enough

00:00:56,535-->00:01:00,383
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

I'm going through withdrawals

5

You don't even have to do too much

00:01:07,972-->00:01:12,109
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

00:01:12,938-->00:01:16,432
I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)

No one's around to judge me (oh)
